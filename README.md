Tiago Splitter
==============

A simple application for splitting up check amongst friends. This was built as a prototype and the plan was to add on more features but my situation changed and there was no more time for this anymore. The project does have many of the basic features of a system that has multiple users which all want to have their own individual data in the system.

The project is done in the Play Framework with scala and was the first one I made with that combo besides trivial ones. It is connected to a MySQL database using slick.

The app is up and running on [link](https://memento-split.herokuapp.com/).
